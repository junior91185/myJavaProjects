This Java program implements Huffman coding, a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters
based on their frequencies. The main class, HuffmanSubmit, constructs a Huffman tree, encodes a given input file, and
writes the encoded message and frequency map to separate output files. The decoding process reads the encoded message
and frequency map, reconstructs the Huffman tree, and produces the original message. The UR_Node class represents nodes
in the Huffman tree, implementing the Comparable interface for sorting based on frequency and character.
The program provides a comprehensive demonstration of Huffman coding, illustrating the steps of encoding and decoding
while showcasing the resulting compressed file and reconstructed original content. Users can easily apply this program
to compress and decompress text files, gaining insight into the inner workings of the Huffman coding algorithm.
