In this lab, I worked on the Hash Table/Map ADT. Build a Linear Probing Hash Table.
The UR_HashTable class serves as the foundational data structure for the hash table.
It provides the core methods and structures for a basic hash table.
The Main class is a concrete implementation of the UR_HashTable class, specializing it with
specific key and value types. In this example, the class uses Integer keys and String values.
It demonstrates how to use the hash table for common operations.
