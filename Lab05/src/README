Hash Tables
This project demonstrates an implementation of such a hash table, including basic operations like 
put, get, and delete, as well as utility functions to manage and interact with the data efficiently.

Usage:
Extend the UR_HashTable class to implement its abstract methods tailored to your specific requirements. 
The provided Main class illustrates a basic extension, implementing linear probing for conflict resolution and showcasing 
usage with integer keys and string values.

Example usage in Main class:
Main<Integer, String> hash = new Main<>(50);
hash.put(26, "Sponge");
hash.put(10, "Kerry");
System.out.println(hash.get(10)); // Output: Kerry
